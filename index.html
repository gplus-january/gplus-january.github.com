                                        <p>
                                            G+ January is a celebration of <a href="http://plus.google.com" target="__new">Google+</a> and all things good that come along with using it. It came about when two ordinary guys, <a href="http://plus.google.com/106387522260613307811" target="__new">+Daniel Pritchett</a> and <a href="http://plus.google.com/102622246738271995921" target="__new">+Ravi Nath</a>, were discussing the pros and cons of Google+ when compared to other social networks. They soon discovered the con was the lack of people they knew that actually used Google+. They came up with the idea of G+ January to help promote the use of Google+ and its many wonderful features, and hopefully win some of their friends over and transform them into &quot;Plussers.&quot;

                                            Well first thing's first, you need to create a google account, if you don't already have one, and sign in to <a href="http://plus.google.com" target="__new">Google+</a>.

                                            Google+ is a feature-rich social network making it increasingly impossible to detail all of the great features it offers, but we'll give it a try. For even more info you can check out the official <a href="http://www.google.com/+/learnmore/" target="__new">Learn More</a> page from Google or take a tour from inside Google+ itself by clicking on the <img src="img/settings.png"> button from the <a href="https://plus.google.com/" target="__new">home page</a> and selecting &quot;Take a tour.&quot;

                                                    Trending topics highlight the trends of public posts that Plussers are making based on both hashtags and the contents of what is being posted. This is a great way to catch up on the latest minute-to-minute buzz on the web.

                                                    Your profile is your identity on Google+ it is where other Plussers can go to look you up. You can choose to share as little or as much information as you wish with the world. You can view posts that you've made as well as make entirely new posts. You can also view any photos and videos you've shared and uploaded.
                                                </p>

                                                    It's your space... decorate it like you want it. Your profile picture is similar to those used by other social networks. Your profile picture appears next to your posts and comments and allows others to identify you quickly without the need for names. So say cheese and say hello to Google+!
                                                    <br/><br/>
                                                    Your cover picture is a decorative image used to keep your profile looking sharp and reflecting who you are.

                                                    Circles are similar to lists in that they organize your friends. They also allow you to filter your home page down to posts by friends within a specific circle. They allow you to separate different groups that you belong to easily which then allows you to make posts that target just the people you want to. Unlike some other social sites you don't have to &quot;friend&quot; someone to add them to a circle or &quot;circle them.&quot;
                                                </p>

                                                    <p>
                                                        When Plussing in the wild you may come across cool new people you would like to add to one or more of your many circles. Perhaps you are even so inspired you want to create a brand-spanking new circle. Doing so is not a problem with this neat feature, simply mouse over their profile picture or name and mini-profile for them pops up that allows you to place them in one of your circles or add them to a new circle.

                                                    Communities allow you to participate in discussions about topics you enjoy with people who also enjoy them, regardless if they are in your circles or not.
